# ZIPtoBar
So, this was actually a really cool project to do. I learned a lot about how to conceptualize a couple concepts that seemed very foreign to me at first, but I guess 
that's how it goes in programming, lol. 

### ZipTest.java 
This is a test class made to call the methods within Zipcode.java that actually do the converting from ZIP to Bar or vice versa. 

### Zipcode.java 
This class is where the magic happens. 

### Postal.java 
A much more eloquently written solution to a problem than what I came up with, but I also wanted to do mine using two classes where as
this class is wrapped up into one nice and neat file.
