# The Monte Carlo Method!
### Description
So, this program takes the idea of the Monte Carlo method and uses it to approximate the value of pi. Basically, the I simulate random attempts of darts thrown on a 
dartboard and use that data in a ratio of comparing what determines the curve of a circle (pi) to the sides of a square. This works because a square with sides length of 
1 is equivalent to the unit circle (x^2 + y^2 = 1).
